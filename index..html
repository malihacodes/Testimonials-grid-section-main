            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            <q> I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. </q>

                <p class="card__testimonial"><q> Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                    structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                    100% recommend! </q>

                    from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

                        refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as
                        a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
